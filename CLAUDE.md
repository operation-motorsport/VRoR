# OPMO Veterans Race - Development Status

## Current State (2025-10-20)

### ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented
- **Bottom Navigation Overlap**: Fixed padding issues where navigation covered content
- **Authentication Loading**: Added timeout protection and fallback mechanisms
- **Login Redirect**: Multiple redirect strategies to ensure navigation after login
- **Admin Role Assignment**: Email-based admin role assignment for authorized users
- **Database Profile Fetching**: Attempts to read actual admin roles from database
- **Session Recovery**: SessionStorage persistence for auth state
- **Error Boundaries**: Global error handling for page crashes
- **Admin Metrics**: Updated fallback counts to show correct numbers
- **Mock Data**: Expanded veterans data from 2 to 5 beneficiaries

### ‚ùå Known Outstanding Issues

#### Authentication & Session Management
- **Session Loss During Navigation**: Users get logged out when clicking between pages
- **Login Loop**: After successful authentication, sometimes shows login screen again
- **Page Refresh Issues**: Refreshing pages can cause authentication failures
- **Database Connection**: Inconsistent database queries affecting user profiles

#### Admin Dashboard
- **Metrics Accuracy**: Still may show incorrect counts despite fallback fixes
- **Database Queries**: Count queries may be failing silently

#### General Navigation
- **Empty Pages**: Sometimes navigation results in blank/broken page renders
- **State Persistence**: Auth state not consistently maintained across page transitions

### üîß Technical Debt

#### Authentication System
- Multiple fallback layers making debugging complex
- Session storage and Supabase auth state conflicts
- Overly defensive error handling masking root causes

#### Database Integration
- Inconsistent database availability
- Hardcoded fallback data may not match reality
- RLS (Row Level Security) issues potentially blocking queries

#### Error Handling
- Too many try/catch blocks making flow hard to follow
- Console logging excessive but still missing key insights
- Error boundaries may be masking JavaScript errors

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

#### Current Auth Flow
1. User signs in ‚Üí Gets Supabase session
2. `fetchUserProfile` attempts database query
3. Falls back to email-based role assignment
4. Multiple redirect mechanisms attempt navigation
5. SessionStorage used for persistence

#### Known Problematic Areas
- `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Overly complex with multiple fallbacks
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - May be causing render loops
- `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` - Multiple competing redirect strategies

### üìã Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Simplify Authentication**
   - Remove unnecessary fallback layers
   - Focus on single reliable auth flow
   - Reduce defensive programming that masks issues

2. **Database Stability**
   - Ensure consistent database connection
   - Fix RLS policies if needed
   - Remove mock data once database is reliable

3. **Session Management**
   - Choose either Supabase session OR sessionStorage, not both
   - Implement proper session invalidation
   - Fix session restoration on page refresh

4. **Error Handling**
   - Remove excessive try/catch blocks
   - Focus on fixing root causes vs. masking symptoms
   - Simplify error boundaries

### üöÄ Deployment Info
- **Live URL**: vror.netlify.app
- **Build Status**: Should be building successfully
- **Last Deploy**: 2025-10-20 (session recovery fixes)

### üíæ Emergency Recovery
If authentication completely breaks:
1. Set `DEBUG_MODE = true` in `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
2. This bypasses all auth checks temporarily
3. Remember to revert after fixing issues
